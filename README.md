# ODIZO Landing Page Replica

A fully responsive landing page inspired by ODIZO's website. I built this to practice responsive web design and improve my skills with Tailwind CSS. The entire project is made with pure HTML and CSS - no JavaScript involved.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - For the structure
- **CSS3** - For styling and responsiveness
- **Tailwind CSS** - Using the browser CDN for utility classes

## What's Inside

This landing page includes all the essential sections you'd expect from a modern website:

- **Responsive Navigation** - The navbar adjusts perfectly across all screen sizes. On mobile, menu items stack neatly, while on desktop they spread out horizontally
- **Hero Section** - Big, bold branding with a tagline and call-to-action button
- **About Us Section** - Company info with some stats and mission statement
- **Contact Form** - A sleek form with proper styling and focus states
- **Footer** - Contact details and social media links

## Responsive Design

The page looks good on everything - phones, tablets, and desktops. I used Tailwind's responsive classes to make sure the layout adapts smoothly:

- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Compact layout, stacked menu items, vertical content sections
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: Better spacing, optimized for medium screens
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: Full horizontal layout with all the breathing room

## Design Choices

Went with a dark theme (black background with grays) because it looks modern and professional. Added blue accents for buttons and highlights to make interactive elements pop. Used monospace fonts to give it that tech/developer vibe.

The contact form has a nice glassmorphism effect with the gray-800 background and subtle borders. All buttons have smooth hover transitions - nothing too flashy, just clean and professional.

## How to Use

Super simple - just download or clone the repo and open the HTML file in any browser. No build tools, no npm install, no dependencies to worry about. It just works.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [your-repo-url]

# Open the file
open index.html
```

Or just download the HTML file and double-click it!
